# Slimefinder
A Bukkit/Spigot plugin. Enables players to detect slime chunks.

Players punch the ground with a slime ball (which item is the "wand" can be configured). Then the player is simply told if the chunk is a slime chunk or not.

Ideas for improvements:
* If positive result, highlight the chunk with slime blocks and possibly particle effects.
* Add an option for enabling cooldown.
* Maybe tie in with common economy plugins and have a chunk check cost something.
